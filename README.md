# vagrant-advanced

This is a more 'real world' example of vagrant configuration with virtualbox that provides 05 virtual machines: one nginx load balancer with https, two nginx http servers, a MySQL database and finally, the management machine with ansible software. Don't forget to create/use another SSH private key.
